# Remote Sensing Background

## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to introduce digital images, datum, and projections, as well as demonstrate concepts of spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution. You will be introduced to image data from several sensors aboard various platforms. At the completion of the lab, you will be able to understand the difference between remotely sensed datasets based on sensor characteristics and how to choose an appropriate dataset based on these concepts. 

## Learning Outcomes

1. Describe the following terms:
  - Digital image
  - Datum 
  - Projection
  - Resolution (spatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric)
2. Navigate the Google Earth Engine console to gather information about a digital image
3. Evaluate the projection and attributes of a digital image
4. Apply image visualization code in GEE to visualize a digital image

# Section 1: Digital image

A digital image, sometimes called a [raster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics), is a block of [pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) [(Besag 1986)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345426). Each pixel has a position, measured with respect to the axes of some coordinate reference system (CRS), such as a [geographic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system). A CRS in Earth Engine is often referred to as a projection, since it combines a shape of the Earth with a [datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum) and a transformation from that spherical shape to a flat map, called a [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection).

</p>


Let‚Äôs view a digital image in GEE to better understand this concept:

1. In the map window of GEE, click on the Point geometry tool using the [geometry drawing tools](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#geometry-tools) to define your area of interest (for the purposes of consistency in this exercise, place a point on the Virginia Tech Drillfield, which will bring you roughly to `[-80.42214051858835,37.227722521394924]`). As a reminder, you can find more information on geometry drawing tools in GEE‚Äôs Guides. Name the import `point`.

2. Import NAIP imagery by searching for 'naip' and choosing the *'NAIP: National Agriculture Imagery Program'* raster dataset. Name the import `naip`. 

3. Get a single, recent NAIP image over your study area and inspect it:

    ```javascript
    //  Get a single NAIP image over the area of interest.  
    var  image = ee.Image(naip  
                          .filterBounds(point)
                          .sort('system:time_start', false)
                          .first());      
    //  Print the image to the console.  
    print('Inspect the image object:', image);     
    //  Display the image with the default visualization.  
    Map.centerObject(point, 18);  
    Map.addLayer(image, {}, 'Original image');
    ```

4. Expand the image object that is printed to the console by clicking on the dropdown triangles. Expand the property called `bands` and expand one of the bands (0, for example). Note that the CRS transform is stored in the `crs_transform` property underneath the band dropdown and the CRS is stored in the `crs` property, which references an EPSG code. 
** EPSG Codes** EPSG codes are 4-5 digit numbers that represent CRS definitions, of which each code represents a particular definition. The acronym EPGS, comes from the (now defunct) European Petroleum Survey Group.  The CRS of our image is [EPSG:26917](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-utm-zone-17n/). You can often learn more about those [EPSG codes](http://www.epsg-registry.org/) from [thespatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/). The CRS transform is a list  `[m00, m01, m02, m10, m11, m12]`  in the notation of [this reference](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html).
   
5. In addition to using the dropdowns, you can also access these data programmatically with the `.projection()` method:

    ```javascript
    // Display the projection of band 0
    print('Inspect the projection of band 0:', image.select(0).projection());
    ```

6. Note that the projection can differ by band, which is why it's good practice to inspect the projection of individual image bands. (If you call `.projection()` on an image for which the projection differs by band, you'll get an error.) Explore the `ee.Projection` docs to learn about useful methods offered by the `Projection` object. (To play with projections offline, try [this tool](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/gprojector/).)


# Section 2: Digital Image Visualization

You've learned about how an image stores pixel data in each band as digital numbers (DNs) and how the pixels are organized spatially. When you add an image to the map, Earth Engine handles the spatial display for you by recognizing the projection and putting all the pixels in the right place. However, you must specify how to stretch the DNs to make an 8-bit display image (e.g., the `min` and `max` visualization parameters). Specifying `min` and `max` applies (where DN' is the displayed value):

` DN' = (DN - min) * 255 / (max - min)`

1. To apply a [gamma correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction) (DN' = DNùõæ), use:

    ```javascript
    // Display gamma stretches of the input image.
    Map.addLayer(image.visualize({gamma: 0.5}), {}, 'gamma = 0.5');
    Map.addLayer(image.visualize({gamma: 1.5}), {}, 'gamma = 1.5');
    ```

Note that gamma is supplied as an argument to [image.visualize()](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-image-visualize) so that you can click on the map to see the difference in pixel values (try it!). It's possible to specify `gamma`, `min`, and `max` to achieve other unique visualizations.

2. (_Optional_) To apply a [histogram equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization) stretch, use the [sldStyle() method](https://devsite.googleplex.com/earth-engine/image_visualization#styled-layer-descriptors):

  ```javascript
  // Define a RasterSymbolizer element with '_enhance_' for a placeholder.
  var histogram_sld =
    '<RasterSymbolizer>' +
      '<ContrastEnhancement><Histogram/></ContrastEnhancement>' +
      '<ChannelSelection>' +
        '<RedChannel>' +
          '<SourceChannelName>R</SourceChannelName>' +
        '</RedChannel>' +
        '<GreenChannel>' +
          '<SourceChannelName>G</SourceChannelName>' +
        '</GreenChannel>' +
        '<BlueChannel>' +
          '<SourceChannelName>B</SourceChannelName>' +
        '</BlueChannel>' +
      '</ChannelSelection>' +
    '</RasterSymbolizer>';

  // Display the image with a histogram equalization stretch.
  Map.addLayer(image.sldStyle(histogram_sld), {}, 'Equalized');
  ```

The `[sldStyle() method](https://devsite.googleplex.com/earth-engine/image_visualization#styled-layer-descriptors)` requires image statistics to be computed in a region (to determine the histogram)
